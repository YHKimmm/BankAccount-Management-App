## Bank Account Management

Bank Account Management is a ASP.NET Core MVC project. It is a comprehensive solution for managing bank accounts. It allows users to create an account with a choice of different bank account types like savings, chequing, RESP, etc.

The application also allows them to edit, delete, and view their bank accounts with the option to sort, search account type, and paginate the list. The database is managed using Microsoft SQL Server, and the application uses sessions to track the client's ID and name. This CRUD-based application offers robust and scalable functionality for managing bank accounts.
